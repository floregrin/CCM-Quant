    "# Q3. You’re about to board a train from London to Newcastle. You want to know if it’s raining, so you call your three friends who live in Newcastle. Each friend has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of telling you a lie. All three friends tell you that, yes, it’s raining in Newcastle. What is the probability that it is, in fact, raining in Newcastle?"
